        <h2>Introduction to myself</h2>
        <p>Hi, My name is Malik Traore. I am a sophomore at Concord Academy. </p>
        <p>I have attended the All Star Code summer intensive, which has helped me gain proficiency with programming languages such as Javascript, HTML, and CSS.</p>
        <p>I am from a town in Essex County, New Jersey. I live there with my family.</p> 
        <p>Some of my hobbies include coding, learning history, and spending time with family and friends.</p>

        <p class="academicsText">I am an incoming sophomore in High School.</p>
        <p class="academicsText"> I choose my coursework based on classes that I think would challenge me intellectually and fuel my curiosity.</p>
        <p class="academicsText"> Here is my coursework for Freshman Year:</p>
        <ul class="academicsText">

        <h2 class="careerHead"> Future Career</h3>
        <p class="careerText1">For my future career, I have always wanted to create change in the world through the tech industry.</p>
        <p class="careerText2">Making webpages, and building apps is something I have dreamed of doing, which is why being a software or web developer is currently my dream job.</p>
        <p class="careerText3">I also like how coding makes you think about different ways of going about problems and makes you see the world through a technical lens.</p>
        <p class="careerText4">Since I started coding I looked at popular websites like youtube, or instagram and I think about how I could recreate those sites or certain features through those sites.</p>
