        <p>For my future career, I have always wanted to create change in the world through the tech industry.</p>
        <p>Making webpages, and building apps is something I have dreamed of doing, which is why being a software or web developer is currently my dream job.</p>
        <p>I like how coding makes you think about different ways of going about problems and makes you see the world through a technical lens.</p>
        <p>Since I started coding I looked at popular websites like youtube, or instagram and I think about how I could recreate those sites or certain features through those sites. </p>
